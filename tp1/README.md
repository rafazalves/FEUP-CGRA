## TP 1 Notes


- In exercise 1 we added a triangle and a parallelogram, and also added checkboxes to change the visibility of both and the pre-existing diamond.

- In exercise 2 we added a small triangle and a big triangle. We also added checkboxes to change the visibility of both just to help screenshotting.
