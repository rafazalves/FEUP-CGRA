- In exercise 1, 2, 4 and 6 we didn't have difficulties.

- In exercise 3 we had difficulties understanding the order in the code to apply the normals.

- In exercise 5 we had difficulties converting the RGB colors.

- In the second part of the TP3, in constant shading the normal is calculated in 1 point and applicated in the whole face, and in this exercise we calculated 1 normal and applicated to all of the vertices of the face.
